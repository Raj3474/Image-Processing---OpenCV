# Image Processing using OpenCV

## Implemente basic image processing 
1. Working with Color Spaces
2. Perform Convolution manually using Numpy
3. working adn apply custom filter with numpy
4. Histogram Equalization using CLAHE
5. Applying Blurring and shapening filter manually.
6. Manual Image Mirroring.
7. Morph Operation on images
8. Add Manual padding with Numpy
9. resizing input images and video stream.


## Implemente Image transformation
1. Canny Edge detector from scratch.
2. Document Scanner pipeline (manually feeding the corner location and finding the corner location by contour method).
3. Watershed_segmentation
4. Feature Matching with Homography
5. Different feature detecting algorithms
   a. SIFT
   b. ORB
6. Different feature matching algorithm.
   a. BruteForce
   b. KnnBruteForce
   c. FLANN
7. Implement ORB feature detection pipeline (step by step)
8. Implement Perspective transfrom from scratch (finding and applying the Homography matrix manually).
